# Toolkit Samples

Sample apps demonstrate usage of the `toolkit-*` modules, each with a GUI, CLI, and web app implemented with clean architecture.

- dmvapp - a thrilling driver's license application simulator with a dash of bureaucracy
- passwordapp - craft your very own password policy, create unique accounts with passwords that satisfy it, and change those passwords to your heart's content

Jokes aside, these apps are just silly technical proofs of concept, not intended to be accurate representations of real-world authentication or government processes.
